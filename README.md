# Matrix Operations

This project implements matrix operations in C++, including **matrix addition** and **matrix multiplication**. The program allows the user to input matrix dimensions and elements, then perform the specified operation on the matrices.

---

## Features
- **Matrix Addition:**
  - Adds two matrices if their dimensions match.
  - Displays the result of the addition.
- **Matrix Multiplication:**
  - Multiplies two matrices if the number of columns of the first matrix matches the number of rows of the second matrix.
  - Displays the result of the multiplication.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Creates and deletes matrices dynamically to handle any size matrix input by the user.
- **Input Validation:** Validates user input for valid matrix dimensions and floating-point values.

---

## Technologies Used
- **C++** for implementing the matrix operations and input handling.
- **Standard Library**: Uses `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<cmath>` for input/output, string handling, and mathematical operations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local system:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the program and select the desired operation (addition or multiplication).
4. Input the matrix dimensions and elements as prompted.
5. View the result of the operation (either addition or multiplication).

## Customization
- You can modify the **getMatrixDimentions** function to handle larger matrices or additional matrix operations.
- **Error handling** can be expanded to handle edge cases such as invalid matrix inputs or memory allocation failures.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Error Handling**: Improve the error handling for invalid matrix dimensions and other edge cases.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Implement the ability to transpose matrices.
- **Matrix Inversion**: Add functionality for matrix inversion for square matrices.
